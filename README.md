Projects created while learning and exploring programming concepts.

                                    PROJECTS:   
Developed predictive models to estimate injury risk in NYC motor vehicle collisions using the NYPD dataset, 
supporting Vision Zero initiatives. 
• Built logistic regression and random forest models for injury prediction. 
• Performed data cleaning, feature engineering, and exploratory analysis. 
• Analyzed behavioral, temporal, vehicle type, and borough-level factors. 
• Provided actionable insights to reduce traffic-related injuries. 

Prediction of Urban Water Quality using Ubiquitous Data 
• Led a 4-member team to develop machine learning models in Python to predict urban water quality trends. 
• Achieved 85% prediction accuracy on test data, enabling timely interventions for water safety. 
• Generated actionable insights that helped identify key contamination sources and optimize monitoring 
schedules. 

Premium Billing Accuracy and Policy Data Synchronization 
• Designed a cloud-based data pipeline using AWS Lambda, S3, and Power BI to automate policy and billing 
data synchronization. 
• Reduced manual reconciliation efforts by 70% and improved billing accuracy by over 95%. 
• Created dashboards that provided real-time visibility into policy updates and discrepancies. 

Predictive Analytics for Project Timelines 
• Built and deployed machine learning models on AWS EC2 to forecast project completion timelines. 
• Improved project delivery prediction accuracy by 20%, aiding in better resource allocation and planning. 
• Enabled proactive mitigation of schedule risks, reducing potential delays by 15%.
